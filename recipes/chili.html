    <h2>A winter staple. </h2>
    <p>This traditional chili recipe is incredibly simple and very tasty. It uses ground beef, beans, hominy, and chili seasonings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion - diced</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tbsp chili powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>1 can (15 oz) petite diced tomato</li>
            <li>1 can (16 oz) red kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 can (15 oz) golden hominy, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the olive oil to a large soup pot and place it over medium-high heat for two minutes. Add the onion. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef to the pot. Break it apart with a wooden spoon. Cook for 6-7 minutes, until the beef is browned, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the chili powder, cumin, sugar, tomato paste, garlic powder, and salt. Stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Add the broth, diced tomatoes (with their juice), beans, hominy, and tomato sauce. Stir well.</li>
            <li>Bring the liquid to a low boil. Then, reduce the heat (low to medium-low) to gently simmer the chili, uncovered, for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the heat. Let the chili rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
